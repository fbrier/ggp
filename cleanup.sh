# This script is provided as a placeholder for a real cleanup script.
# It is called by the Proxy between matches, and should clean up all
# of the temporary files that the gamer might leave around, but that
# don't need to be preserved between matches.
#
# If you are not using the Proxy, or your player does not generate
# temporary files on disk, you can feel free to ignore this script.
# Otherwise, it might be useful to override it with a version that
# cleans up the temporary files.
